## Project Five: Web Scraping Business Open and Close Time
  *Description: Staples Business Solutions devlivers to around 50,000 businesses on any given day. Due to lack of information on these businesses about 1,500 delivereis fail due to the customer not being at their location and the cost per redelivery is about $1. Using open source APIs I was able to create a web scraping script that I entigrated into an online website that allowed the user to upload an excel file with their orders for the day. This would then run my script scraping Google's freely avaliable information on when the business self reported they would be open and closed. Staples has decided to move forward with incorporating my tool into their delivery system saving the company an average of $100,000 a year. The total cost of tools to build this program was $0.  
  
  *Tools: Python, BeautifulSoup, CGI, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, JSP, MYSQL Workbench
